##' treatment periods defined by pill consumption
##'
##' Given a data frame ('data') with individuals (identified by 'id'), treatment
##' ('state') initiated (or continued) at 't' by adding a number of pills
##' ('pills') to an inventory of such, we calculate the times at which treatment
##' ends and reverts back to the 'null.state' (or changes), assuming that pills
##' are consumed by 'usage' each time unit. Note 1: if new pills (for the same
##' treatment/state) arrives before the previous pills are consumed, the new
##' pills will be added to the inventory of pills, i.e. they can be stockpiled.
##' Note 2: if a different treatement is initiated before the pills of the
##' previous treatment are consumed, the old inventory is nullified and a new
##' treatment period begins. Note 3: duplicated times (per individual) will be
##' ignored. Note 4: a treatment will be ongoing as long as there are pills,
##' i.e. if e.g. usage is 2 and the current inventory of pills is 1, the
##' treatment will be considered active one more unit of time. Note 5:
##' 'capacity' kicks in after the daily pills have been consumed, i.e. if you
##' initiate a treatment with a 100 pills but only have capacity for 10, you
##' will consume 'usage' pills, and then have 10 left in the inventory.
##' @param data a data.frame containing 'id', 't', 'state' and, optionally,
##'     'run'.
##' @param id character; name of id variable
##' @param t character; name of time variable
##' @param state character; name of treatment variable
##' @param pills character; name of variable keeping track of pills added to
##'     (treatment specific) inventory
##' @param usage either name of variable (character) keeping track of pill
##'     usage, or the numeric value for all pill usage. If given as a name that
##'     does not exist in data, the value 1 will be assigned.
##' @param capacity either name of variable (character) keeping track of upper
##'     bound for the size of the pill inventory, or the numeric value for all
##'     pill inventory capacities. If given as a name that does not exist in
##'     data, the value Inf will be assigned.
##' @param null.state value for 'state' when treatment ends
##' @param simplify logical; if TRUE keep only minimal information enough to
##'     keep track of changes in treatment.
##' @return a data.frame

##' ## note that initial state A will be active until t = 2
##' ## note that the 10 remaining pills from state C initiated at 35 (with a
##' ##   usage of 2 until) ending at 40 (when usage changes to 1) are added
##' ##   to the inventory so that state C can remain active until t = 70
